                I am a developer and product (UX/UI) designer focused on building thoughtful digital experiences. I have designed and built immersive digital experiences, insightful data visualizations and effective, usable applications. My most impactful work involved designing products that use data to aid public health policy-making for the US CDC, ASEAN and WHO . My data visualizations have appeared in The Economist, The Washington Post, and The Lancet Infectious Diseases. My projects have been featured on CBC, The Creators Project, CP24, Forbes and more.

                I am inspired by the opportunities presented by new technologies and new media. Iâ€™m always looking to build and design compelling experiences, innovative ways of engaging with information through our world of connected objects, data visualizations and screen-based interfaces.
                </p><p>
                I have a particular interest in design and development for social benefit and civic engagement. My goal is to imagine and create a brighter future.
